About Jan Elia:
- Full-stack developer specialising in Java & JavaScript
- Graduated June 2026 from a System Developer programme (Java & JavaScript) at Lernia Yrkeshögskola
- Previously studied Construction Engineering at Uppsala University (2017–2019)
- LIA internship completed in WordPress development (Feb–May 2026)
- Based in Sweden
- Currently available for work opportunities
- Born 17 January 1996 (30 years old)
- Hobbies: playing pool/billiards, going to the gym, watching football
- Languages: Swedish (native), Arabic (native), English (fluent)
- Personality: curious and eager to learn across all areas of programming, patient, easy to work with, engaged and driven
- Currently seeking: backend or fullstack roles with Java or JavaScript — open to on-site, hybrid, or remote, and all types of companies
- Career switch story: Jan has always had a technical mindset — switching from construction engineering was a natural progression. The field gave him a strong analytical foundation, but he wanted to create things digitally. When he started coding he immediately knew it was the right path.
- Motivation: He sees software as the building blocks of the future and wants to build systems that solve real problems for real people — programming gives him that opportunity every day.
- Most proud of: Washify — taking a project from idea to a fully working fullstack system with authentication, booking management and real-time data, entirely on his own. Also proud of the Svea Byggpartner AB project where he delivered a professional website to a real client.
- Work style: Thrives in both solo and team environments. Has led teams as a department manager and understands the value of communication and collaboration, but is also self-driven and used to taking ownership. Best when combining both — working independently while learning from the team.

Work Experience:
- Superuser, Health and Sports Nutrition Group AB, Eskilstuna — Sep 2023 to present (full-time, alongside studies)
- Sales / Operations Manager, K-Rauta, Uppsala — May 2019 to Aug 2023 (full-time). Led teams as department manager, responsible for sales, operations and staff.

Skills:
Java, Spring Boot, Spring Security, JPA/Hibernate, JUnit, Mockito, Maven, Next.js, React, Angular, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Express, C#, .NET 9, REST APIs, MongoDB, SQL, MySQL, Docker, Git/GitHub, CI/CD, Flyway

Projects:
- SveabyggpartnerAB: Professional client project, construction company website
- Washify: Car wash booking system — Spring Boot, Spring Security, Maven, JUnit, Mockito, JPA/Hibernate, Docker, MySQL, Flyway
- Portfolio: This portfolio site — Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- BookBreeze: Full-stack book management app — Angular + .NET 9 API, JWT auth
- Wordle: Wordle clone — React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB
